# Face-Mask-Detection

This repository contains a face mask detection model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and trained on the Kaggle Face Mask Detection dataset.


The face mask detection model is built using CNN, which is a deep learning algorithm that is widely used for image classification tasks.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the validation set and can accurately detect face masks in real-time using the webcam.

## Conclusion
The face mask detection model built using CNN on the Kaggle dataset can accurately detect face masks in images and videos. This model can be further improved by increasing the size of the dataset and fine-tuning the hyperparameters.
